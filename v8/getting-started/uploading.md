# Upload a Template to The Editor in V8

The functionality and process of uploading a template to the V8 Editor isn't much different to V7, however locating it is. To upload a template to the V8 Editor:

1. Go to **Site Settings** within the main menu
   {% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/v8/getting-started/site-settings-item.png" alt="Site settings list" %}

2. Then select **Custom templates** item
3. Select either **Add from GitHub** or **Upload ZIP**. In our example we're uploading a template as a ZIP file, but you can add a repo from GitHub which you can then update or 'sync'
   {% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/v8/getting-started/template-upload.png" alt="Upload custom template" %}

Once complete the template you've uploaded should appear as an item within Custom templates. Note that if you add a template using a GitHub repo you'll need to go to Custom templates each time you push a change to update the template in the Editor.
