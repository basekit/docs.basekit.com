# Downloading a Template in V8

Activating the **Developer Mode** within the V8 Editor is much the same as doing it in V7. To download a template you'll need to do the following:

1. Go to the **Developer tab** in the Editor and accept the terms that are presented to you. You'll then be presented with the online code editor.
   {% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/v8/getting-started/developer-tab.png" alt="online code editor" %}

2. Click the icon at the top right of the screen. Then click **"Download template ZIP"** to download the currently selected template.
   {% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/v8/getting-started/download-template.png" alt="download template" %}



3. Once downloaded, **unzip the template**. You should be then presented with a folder containing a selection of files, some of which will be the following:

   * `stylesheet.less`: this is where you'll add your styles using CSS or LESS for example
   * `default.twig`: this is the default layout for all your pages. You can add more Twig files later
   * `metadata.json`: this is where you will set all your [options for your template](/templating/metadata/)
   * `templatename-screenshot.png`: A preview of the template, needed to better present templates in the Editor

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/v8/getting-started/template-files.png" alt="template files" %}

## What's next?

Now that you have a template to edit with locally you'll need the **Template Development Kit** to develop your template and see the changes, see [Local Development](/getting-started/local-development/) for more information.
