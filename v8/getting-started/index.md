# Getting Started with V8

If you're familiar with developing a template in V7 of the Editor, then you'll be fairly comfortable in developing a template for V8. The main methods haven't changed, such as most of the files for a template and how to use it with the Editor, but there are some nuances that you'll need to watch out for.

## Key points

The key points to consider when working on a template in the new Editor:

- Gaining access to **Developer Mode**, which includes downloading and editing template, has changed in the new Editor. Check out [Downloading a Template in V8](/v8/getting-started/downloading/) for more information
- There is a new version of the **code editor in V8**, more information can be found in [Editing a Template for V8](/v8/getting-started/editing/)
- There is now a wider array of **template variables** for developers to use, these will then be controllable in the new V8 Editor, more information can be found in [Metadata in V8](/v8/templating/metadata/)

## What's next?

The next step is to download a template in V8, see [Downloading a template in V8](/v8/getting-started/downloading/).
