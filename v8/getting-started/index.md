# Getting Started with V8

## TBC

Key points to make:

- Mention v7, but don't rely on the reader to have used v7
- Link to certain sections of v7 if it simplifies things
- What's different about v7 and v8
- Link users to partners with v8 installed
- How to enable developer mode in v8
- What the developer mode looks like in v8 and how it works
- What the new TDK looks like and how things work
