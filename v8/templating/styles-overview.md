title: Style Variables in V8

# Styles Overview

The V8 styles feature allows the user to change the appearance, or ‘style’ for specific widget elements, as well as site wide styles. This means the user has granular control over the appearance of their site.


The user is able to click widgets within a section to quickly edit related section / element styles. E.g. if the ‘company name’ widget was selected - you are able to edit the style of the navigation, header and feature etc.

## Editing styles

### Widget Styles

The user is able to change the widget style by clicking a widget and selecting the ‘style’ tab from the widget settings. This menu allows the user to change fonts and colours for the selected widget.

### Site Styles

The user is able to change site styles by selecting the ‘site styles’ link from the site options menu. This menu allows the user to change background properties (BG type, BG colour etc) and content styles (H1 - H4, P etc).
