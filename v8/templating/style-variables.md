# V8 styles overview

## Styles Overview

The V8 styles feature allows the user to change the appearance, or ‘style’ for specific widget elements, as well as site wide styles. This means the user has granular control over the appearance of their site.

The user is able to click widgets within a section to quickly edit related section / element styles. E.g. if the ‘company name’ widget was selected - you are able to edit the style of the navigation, header and feature etc.

## Editing styles
