# Downloading a Template in V7

> **Note**: If you're using version 8 of the Editor please use the V8 documentation: [Downloading a Template in V8](/v8/getting-started/downloading/).

## Download the zip file

To access the code of your chosen template, open the **Developer** tab:

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/template-tab.png" alt="template tab" %}

The code editor will appear. At the top of the code editor panel you will see a settings cog. Click this to reveal the settings menu.

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/open-settings.png" alt="developer panel settings menu icon" %}

A menu will appear on the right of the template panel. Click on the **Download template** link to download the zip file.

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/download-template.png" alt="download template" %}

Once downloaded, you'll be able to open the file and see the following basics:

* `stylesheet.less`: this is where you'll add your styles using CSS or LESS for example

* `default.twig`: this is the default layout for all your pages. You can add more Twig files later

* `metadata.json`: this is where you will set all your [options for your template](/templating/metadata/)

{% include imagecenter.html image="/assets/content/getting-started/template-files.png" alt="template files" %}
