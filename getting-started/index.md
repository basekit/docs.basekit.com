# Getting Started with V7

> **Note**: If you're using version 8 of the Editor please see the V8 documentation: [Getting Started with V8](/v8/getting-started/).

In this document we'll explain the main elements you'll need in order to get started with editing, or creating, your own template.

To get started you're going to need the following:

1. ## Access to the Editor
   If you have come to us through the editor, you will already be signed up and logged in via your hosting/telecoms package. [Head straight to Step 2](#enable-developer-mode).

   Don't have an account? Head to our [developer partner page](http://www.basekit.com/partners#partners) to find a partner to sign up with.

2. ## Enable Developer Mode
   To do this click the **Developer** tab in the editor and read the terms and conditions presented to you before accepting them.

   It will read as follows: _By accepting the terms and conditions you are confirming you have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS, as you will not be able to use this feature without these skills._


3. ## The Template Development Kit
   The TDK, or Template Development Kit, will allow you to view your changes to a template without the need to upload your changes every time.

   You can download the TDK from the following sources:

   - {% include button.html link="http://basekit-tdk.s3.amazonaws.com/tdk-stable.zip" text="Download Current Stable Version" icon="cloud-download" %} (stable)
   - [Download Specific Version](https://github.com/basekit-templates/tdk/wiki)

4. ## A code editor
   A code editor will allow you to edit a template locally. Don't worry if you don't have access to one, as there is a code editor built into the online Editor within Developer Mode.

   When opening the **Developer** tab the code editor will appear. You can start editing your template's files via this editor. Once you have completed your changes, click Save. Your site will reload and your changes will be visible.
