# Getting Started with V7

> **Note**: If you're using version 8 of the Editor please use the V8 documentation: [Getting Started with V8](/v8/getting-started/).

You'll need the following before you start working on a template:

1. ## Access to the Editor
  If you have come to us through the editor, you will already be signed up and logged in via your hosting/telecoms package. [Head straight to Step 2](#enable-developer-mode).

  Don't have an account? Head to our [developer partner page](http://www.basekit.com/our-partners) to find a partner to sign up with.

2. ## Enable Developer Mode
   To do this, simply click the **Developer** tab in the editor.
   By accepting the terms and conditions you are confirming you have a good knowledge of HTML and CSS, as you will not be able to use this feature without these skills.

3. ## The Template Development Kit
   [Download the Template Development Kit](http://basekit-tdk.s3.amazonaws.com/tdk-stable.zip) and unzip it. We recommend creating a new folder at the root of your machine, something like 'Sites' next to your Documents folder.

   {% include button.html link="http://basekit-tdk.s3.amazonaws.com/tdk-stable.zip" text="Download Current Stable Version" icon="cloud-download" %} (stable)

   {% include button.html link="http://basekit-tdk.s3.amazonaws.com/tdk-develop.zip" text="Latest / Bleeding Edge Version" icon="cloud-download" %} (development)

   [Download Specific Version](https://github.com/basekit-templates/tdk/wiki)

4. ## A code editor
   When opening the **Developer** tab the code editor will appear. You can start editing your template's files via this editor. Once you have completed your changes, click Save. Your site will reload and your changes will be visible.
